Lei Yu is a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu/). Before that, he was a Research Staff Member at IBM Research, [IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center](https://research.ibm.com/labs/watson/). He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). His research interests include data privacy and security, trustworthy AI, machine learning systems, and mobile/cloud computing.

<!-- **To prospective graduate students**: Multiple Ph.D student (RA) positions are available. I am looking for self-motivated students who have strong interests in data privacy/security, trustworthy AI, exploiting and optimizing machine learning systems. If you are interested, drop me an e-mail with your CV and transcripts, and also please apply [here](https://admissions.rpi.edu/graduate/masters-and-phd-applicants) and mention my name in your application. -->


## About Me
<p>
My research interests focus on data privacy, AI security, and the application of machine learning to system security.
<span style="padding: 2px 4px; background-color: #f9f9f9; border-radius: 4px; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic;">
I aim to identify threats and risks across the entire data lifecycle, analyze the limitations of current privacy protection mechanisms, and develop principled algorithmic and system-level solutions. The goal is to ensure regulatory compliance and effectively safeguard data privacyâ€”while maintaining practical data utility.</span>
</p>


During my Ph.D. at Georgia Institute of Technology, I focused on big data privacy and deep learning privacy. After completing my Ph.D., I joined IBM Research, where I worked on privacy identification and protection in diagnostic system data, large-scale log-based anomaly detection, AI-Ops, and machine learning system optimization. Earlier in my academic journey, I worked on wireless sensor networks during my Ph.D. study at Harbin Institute of Technology in China.
