## About Me
My recent research interests focus on data privacy, AI security and machine learning techniques for system security. My research on data privacy targets at identifying privacy threats and risks during different phases of data life-cycle and the issues of existing privacy protection designs, and developing principled privacy-preserving algorithmic and systematic solutions. The goal is to effectively protect data privacy and ensure regulatory compliance while preserving data utility.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology, focusing on research in big data privacy and deep learning privacy. After that, I joined IBM Research, where my work has spanned large-scale log based system anomaly detection, AI-Ops, system data privacy identification and protection, and machine learning system optimization. Earlier in my academic journey, I worked on wireless sensor networks during my Ph.D. study at Harbin Institute of Technology in China.
