Hi! I’m Lei Yu, a Research Staff Member at [IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center](https://research.ibm.com/labs/watson/). My research interests include data privacy, big data analytics & systems, the security and privacy of machine learning, large-scale machine learning systems, and cloud and mobile computing. I received my Ph.D. on the topic of big data privacy and deep learning with differential privacy from the School of Computer Science at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/).

## My work and research
My recent research focuses on data privacy and machine learning security. Today vast amounts of data are being collected by tech companies and organizations, ranging from search queries,social activities, photos, to even people’s daily locations. While being turned into new fuel that drives companies’ business such as targeted advertisement and personalized services, those big data have brought forth significant privacy concerns and real risks. Data privacy protection has been actively pursued in regulations and laws such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) that represents the biggest change in data protection legislation in over two decades. However, technically it is challenging to effectively protect data privacy and ensure regulatory compliance while preserving data utility, which calls for innovative algorithmic and systematic solutions. My research on data privacy targets at identifying important privacy threats and risks during different phases of a data life-cycle and the issues of existing privacy protection designs, and developing principled privacy-preserving approaches with the goal of optimizing the trade-off between data privacy and utility.

In IBM Research I also work on system anamoly detection, log analytics, machine learning system optimization for enterprise systems.
